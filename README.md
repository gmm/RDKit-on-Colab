# RDKit-on-Colab
This is a gentle introduction to chemistry and cheminformatics. RDKit is a great toolkit for working with molecules. [RDKit](http://rdkit.org/index.html) works in both C++ and [Python](http://rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html). Google offers free compute resources in the cloud, and one way to use them is through their [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) interface, which is very similar to [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) [Notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html). The goal here is to show you how to install and run RDKit on Google Colab, and learn something about molecules and cheminformatics.

To get started, click on the notebook file ''RDKit_Google_Colab.ipynb'') and then click on the "Open in Colab" button. This should open a new tab on Google Colab, ready to run the code in the cloud.
