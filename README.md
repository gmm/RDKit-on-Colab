# RDKit-on-Colab
This is an introduction to cheminformatics, teaching you how to install conda and run RDKit on Google Colab.

To get started, click on a notebook (file ending in ''.ipynb'') and then click on the "Open in Colab" button. This should open a new tab on Google Colab, ready to run the code in the cloud.
