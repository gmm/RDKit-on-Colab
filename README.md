# RDKit-on-Colab
This is a gentle introduction to chemistry and cheminformatics. The RDKit is great for working with small chemical compounds and molecules in a computer. The [RDKit](http://rdkit.org/index.html) works in both C++ and [Python](http://rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html).

Google offers free computational resources in the cloud through their [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) interface.This lets you type in Python code or formatted text (using Markdown) in blocks called "cells", and is very similar to [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) [Notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html). 

The goal here is to show you how to install and run RDKit on Google Colab, and learn something about molecules and cheminformatics.

To get started, click on the notebook file ‘’[RDKit_Google_Colab.ipynb](https://github.com/gmm/RDKit-on-Colab/blob/main/RDKit_Google_Colab.ipynb)’’ and then click on the "Open in Colab" button. This should open a new tab on Google Colab, ready to run the code in the cloud.
