There are different types of covalent bonds: single, double, and triple bonds, in which one, two, or three pairs of electrons respectively are shared between the bonded atoms. The strongest bonds are triple, followed by double bonds, then single bonds. The stronger the bond, the shorter they tend to be. A C-C single bond is typically about 1.5 A.\n",

For example, ethane has the chemical formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and the two carbon atoms are connected by a single bond, also known as a 'saturated' bond. Ethene also has two carbon atoms, but it has a double (or 'unsaturated') bond between the carbons, and the formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Ethane is saturated, while ethene is unsaturated.\n",

They can also have other elements like phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S).

        "## Hydrogen Bonds\n",
        "\n",
        "[Hydrogen bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond) are weak, directional interactions that arise as a result of differences in [electronegativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity) between hydrogen (less electronegative) and atoms like oxygen and nitrogen (more electronegative). The difference in electronegativity between two atoms in a bond causes the electrons in the bond(s) between the atoms to be distributed unequally, so one atom becomes slightly positively charged, and the other slightly negative. A hydrogen bond involves a hydrogen bond donor such as an N-H group, and a hydrogen bond acceptor such as an oxygen atom, and is often represented by dotted lines: N-H•••O. H-bonds while weak are highly directional: the angle from the H-bonding donor atom, via the H to the H-bonding acceptor tends to be ~180°. This leads to emergent local structure btween molecules, such as the tetrahedral lattice in water ice; or (secondary structure in proteins)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_secondary_structure] formed by adjacent backbone amide groups.\n",

These interactions are ionic, and involve positively charged (\"cationic\") and negatively charged (\"anionic\") groups. These types of interactions are observed between postively (arginine, lysine and sometimes histidine sidechains) and negatively charged amino acid (aspartic and glutamic acids) side chains (and their N- and C-termini). It's also possible for small molecule drugs to form salt bridges to amino acids in proteins, *e.g.* tamiflu binding to neuraminidase spikes in influenza virus)\n",

Just like graphs, molecules can be linear, branched, or cyclic with the atoms arranged in *so called* rings. A saturated hydrocarbon 6-membered ring consists of six carbon atoms connected by six single bonds and is called *saturated*: this molecule is called \"cyclohexane\", and is an example of an \"aliphatic ring\"; it has the chemical formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub> But it is also possible to have a *unsaturated* 6-membered hydrocarbon ring with six carbons and alternating single and double bonds: this molecule is called \"benzene\", and is known as an \"[aromatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_compound) ring\"; it has the chemical formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. [Aromatic rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_aromatic_ring) feature heavily in small molecule drugs. One of the features of [aromaticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity) are the rings of negative electron clouds above and below the plane of the atoms.

[Benzene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene), like all aromatic rings, is flat; but aliphatic cyclohexane is three-dimensional. Because it is possible to rotate connected atoms about a single bond, cyclohexane can adopt different [conformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclohexane_conformation). The most stable is the *chair* conformation, and the least stable, highest energy state is the *boat* conformation; intermediate between these two is the *twist boat* conformation.\n",

        "Small molecule drugs (sometimes referred to as 'ligands') bind to their target or targets, usually via non-covalent interactions such as H-bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions. A key concept in these interactions is *complementarity*: an H-bond donor in the ligand interacts with an H-bond acceptor in the target; a positively charged group in the ligand interacts with a negatively charged group in the target; and so on. In addition to these electrostatic interactions, there are *steric* interactions, governed by [shape complementarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)#Shape_complementarity), a bit like \"knobs\" fitting into \"holes\". Many of these concepts are embodied in protein-ligand [docking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)) software, where a search of the conformational, translational, and orientational degrees of freedom of a protein and ligand is performed using a [scoring function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)#Scoring_function) that quantifies the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions.\n",

This  definition discards a misuse  often  found in the medicinal  chemistry literature which consists of naming  as pharmacophores simple chemical functionalities such  as guanidines,  sulfonamides or dihydroimidazoles (formerly imidazolines), or typical  structural skeletons such as flavones, phenothiazines, prostaglandins or steroids.\"\n",

Very often, our models are built on the assumption we have one molecule as input--but a salt will appear as two molecules (the sodium ion and the acetate ion). We might also have been given the negatively-charged acetate instead of the neutral acetic acid.\n",

        "\n",
        "The molecule parsing functions all, by default, perform a “sanitization” operation on the molecules read. The idea is to generate useful computed properties (like hybridization, ring membership, _etc._) for the rest of the code and to ensure that the molecules are “reasonable”: that they can be represented with octet-complete Lewis dot structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the steps involved, in order:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. ``clearComputedProps``: removes any computed properties that already exist\n",
        "on the molecule and its atoms and bonds. This step is always performed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. ``cleanUp``: standardizes a small number of non-standard valence states. The clean up operations are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Neutral 5 valent Ns with double bonds to Os are converted to the zwitterionic form. Example: ``N(=O)=O -> [N+](=O)O-]``\n",
        "\n",
        "* Neutral 5 valent Ns with triple bonds to another N are converted to the zwitterionic form. Example: ``C-N=N#N -> C-N=[N+]=[N-]``\n",
        "\n",
        "* Neutral 5 valent phosphorus with one double bond to an O and another to either a C or a P are converted to the zwitterionic form. Example: ``C=P(=O)O -> C=[P+]([O-])O``\n",
        "\n",
        "* Neutral Cl, Br, or I with exclusively O neighbors, and a valence of 3, 5, or 7, are converted to the zwitterionic form. This covers things like chlorous acid, chloric acid, and perchloric acid. Example: ``O=Cl(=O)O -> [O-][Cl+2][O-]O``\n",
        "\n",
        "This step should not generate exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. ``updatePropertyCache``: calculates the explicit and implicit valences on all atoms. This generates exceptions for atoms in higher-than-allowed valence states. This step is always performed, but if it is “skipped” the test for non-standard valences will not be carried out.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. ``symmetrizeSSSR``: calls the symmetrized smallest set of smallest rings algorithm (discussed in the [Getting Started](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html) document).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. ``Kekulize``: converts aromatic rings to their [Kekule form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity). Will raise an exception if a ring cannot be kekulized or if aromatic bonds are found outside of rings.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. ``assignRadicals``: determines the number of radical electrons (if any) on each atom.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. ``setAromaticity``: identifies the aromatic rings and ring systems (see above), sets the aromatic flag on atoms and bonds, sets bond orders to aromatic.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. ``setConjugation``: identifies which bonds are conjugated\n",
        "\n",
        "9. ``setHybridization``: calculates the hybridization state of each atom\n",
        "\n",
        "10. ``cleanupChirality``: removes chiral tags from atoms that are not sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. ``adjustHs``: adds explicit Hs where necessary to preserve the chemistry. This is typically needed for heteroatoms in aromatic rings. The classic example is the nitrogen atom in [pyrrole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrole).\n",
