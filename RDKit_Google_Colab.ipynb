        "## Organic Molecules\n",
        "\n",
        "[Organic molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound) are made up of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), usually have nitrogen (N) and/or oxygen (O); and can have other elements like phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S). Small molecule drugs can contain other elements, like halogens: fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), Bromine (Br), and/or iodine (I); or other elements such as boron (B).\n",

        "Pairs of adjacent atoms in molecules are held together by strong covalent bonds, which are formed when the atom pairs share their outermost electrons. There are different types of covalent bonds: single, double, and triple bonds, in which one, two, or three pairs of electrons respectively are shared between the bonded atoms. The strongest bonds are triple, then double, then single. The stronger the bond, the shorter they tend to be.\n",

Hydrocarbons are compounds made up of hydrogen and carbon. A fully saturated hydrocarbon compound has the highest hydrogen to carbon ratio, while an unsaturated compound has the least hydrogen. For example, ethane has the chemical formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and the two carbon atoms are connected by a single bond. Ethene also has two carbon atoms, but it has a double bond between the carbons, and the formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Ethane is saturated, while ethene is unsaturated.\n",

        "\n",
        "There are also non-covalent bonds, which are weaker than covalent bonds, and can form between parts of the same molecule, or between different molecules. One of the most common non-covalent bond is the hydrogen bond, or \"H-bond\" for short.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hydrogen Bonds\n",
        "\n",
        "[Hydrogen bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond) are weak, directional interactions that arise as a result of differences in [electronegativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity) between hydrogen (less electronegative) and atoms like oxygen and nitrogen (more electronegative). The difference in electronegativity between two atoms in a bond causes the electrons in the bond(s) between the atoms to be distributed unequally, so one atom becomes slightly positively charged, and the other slightly negative. A hydrogen bond involves a hydrogen bond donor such as an N-H group, and a hydrogen bond acceptor such as an oxygen atom, and is often represented by dotted lines: N-H•••O. H-bonds while weak are highly directional: the angle from the H-bonding donor atom, via the H to the H-bonding acceptor tends to be ~180°. This leads to emergent local structure btween molecules, such as the tetrahedral lattice in water ice; or (secondary structure in proteins)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_secondary_structure] formed by adjacent backbone amide groups.\n",

        "## Salt Bridges\n",
        "\n",
        "When the two groups or atoms interacting are charged, they can form salt bridges. These interactions are ionic, and involve positively charged (\"cationic\") and negatively charged (\"anionic\") groups. These types of interactions are observed between postively (arginine, lysine and sometimes histidine sidechains) and negatively charged amino acid (aspartic and glutamic acids) side chains (and their N- and C-termini). It's also possible for small molecule drugs to form salt bridges to amino acids in proteins, *e.g.* tamiflu binding to neuraminidase spikes in influenza virus)\n",

        "\n",
        "Molecules can be thought of as (graphs)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory] where the nodes are atoms and the edges are bonds. Just like graphs, molecules can be linear, branched, or cyclic with the atoms arranged in *so called* rings. A saturated hydrocarbon 6-membered ring consists of six carbon atoms connected by six single bonds and is called *saturated*: this molecule is called \"cyclohexane\", and is an example of an \"aliphatic ring\"; it has the chemical formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub> But it is also possible to have a *unsaturated* 6-membered hydrocarbon ring with six carbons and alternating single and double bonds: this molecule is called \"benzene\", and is known as an \"[aromatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_compound) ring\"; it has the chemical formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. [Aromatic rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_aromatic_ring) feature heavily in small molecule drugs. One of the features of [aromaticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity) are the rings of negative electron clouds above and below the plane of the atoms. Another feature is molecular shape.\n",

        "The shape of aromatic and aliphatic 6-membered carbon rings is quite different. [Benzene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene), like all aromatic rings, is flat; but aliphatic cyclohexane is three-dimensional. Because it is possible to rotate connected atoms about a single bond, cyclohexane can adopt different [conformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclohexane_conformation). The most stable is the *chair* conformation, and the least stable, highest energy state is the *boat* conformation; intermediate between these two is the *twist boat* conformation.\n",

They also have properties such as [molecular weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_mass) (the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in the molecule, measured in Daltons, or \"Da\"); and counts, such as the number of non-hydrogen 'heavy' atoms, or the number of hydrogren bond donors.

        "Small molecule drugs (sometimes referred to as 'ligands') bind to their target or targets, usually via non-covalent interactions such as H-bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions. A key concept in these interactions is *complementarity*: an H-bond donor in the ligand interacts with an H-bond acceptor in the target; a positively charged group in the ligand interacts with a negatively charged group in the target; and so on. In addition to these electrostatic interactions, there are *steric* interactions, governed by [shape complementarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)#Shape_complementarity), a bit like \"knobs\" fitting into \"holes\". Many of these concepts are embodied in protein-ligand [docking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)) software, where a search of the conformational, translational, and orientational degrees of freedom of a protein and ligand is performed using a [scoring function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)#Scoring_function) that quantifies the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions.\n",

This  definition discards a misuse  often  found in the medicinal  chemistry literature which consists of naming  as pharmacophores simple chemical functionalities such  as guanidines,  sulfonamides or dihydroimidazoles (formerly imidazolines), or typical  structural skeletons such as flavones, phenothiazines, prostaglandins or steroids.\"\n",
